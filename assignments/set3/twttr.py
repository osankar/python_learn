"""
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by 
omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py,
 implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text 
 but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

tweet = input("Input: ")
out = ""
for c in tweet:
    if c.lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
        continue
    out+=c

print(out)
